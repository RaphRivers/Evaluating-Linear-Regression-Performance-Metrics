# Evaluating-Linear-Regression-Performance-Metrics

This repository provides an overview of performance metrics used for evaluating regression models. It covers two main types of metrics:

1. R-squared: A measure of the general linear relationship between predicted and observed values, indicating how well the model explains the variability of the target variable.
2. Error Metrics: Summarizes model errors through:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE): These metrics are based on squared errors and provide insight into the average squared differences between predicted and actual values.
   -  and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): RMSE is particularly useful for interpreting error in the same units as the target variable.
   -  Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This metric, based on absolute errors, gives the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.

## Useful Application Examples
1. Real Estate Pricing
When predicting house prices based on features like square footage, location, and number of bedrooms, R-squared helps assess how well the model captures the variance in prices, while MSE or RMSE can indicate the typical error in price predictions.

2. Sales Forecasting
In predicting future sales based on historical data, R-squared can show the effectiveness of the model in capturing sales trends, and MAE can help businesses understand the average forecasting error, guiding inventory and marketing strategies.

3. Customer Lifetime Value Prediction
For businesses estimating customer lifetime value based on historical purchase data, R-squared indicates the model's explanatory power, while RMSE can provide a tangible understanding of prediction errors, which is crucial for budgeting and resource allocation.

4. Stock Price Prediction
When developing models to forecast stock prices based on various financial indicators, R-squared quantifies how well the model captures price movements, and MAE can provide a clear picture of the average prediction error, aiding in investment decisions.

5. Health Outcomes Prediction
In healthcare, predicting patient outcomes based on demographic and clinical data requires robust regression models. R-squared can reflect the model's explanatory strength, while RMSE can help assess the accuracy of predictions, crucial for patient care and resource planning.
